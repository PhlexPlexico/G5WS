# Get5 Web Stats (G5WS)
**Status: Not Supported/Deprecated**  
While this plugin still has support for get5 versions under 0.13, it is highly recommended you update your game servers and use version >= 2.0.0.0 of G5API. Get5 now includes everything that this plugin had, and more.


Sourcemod plugin for G5API.

This plugin is to be used in conjuction with [G5API](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5API). It includes various changes, such as tracking vetoes to a database, and uploading the demo of a match once the match is completed.

# Requirements
In order to **compile** this (if you wish to make changes), you must have:

- [SteamWorks Includes](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/SteamWorks/blob/master/Pawn/includes/SteamWorks.inc)

In order to **use** this on your game server, you must have:

- [SteamWorks Extension Installed](https://splewis.github.io/get5/latest/installation/#steamworks).

Once the first requirement is met, you may build the plugin with `spcomp`.  
If you do not wish to build from source, the latest version of the 
plugin is both available in the releases [G5WS](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5WS/releases).

# FAQ
Q. My install isn't working!  
A. Make sure you have installed the [SteamWorks](https://splewis.github.io/get5/latest/installation/#steamworks) extension on your server. This library makes the HTTP calls to the web server.

Q. I'm getting "Unexpected JSON at line X"  
A. This is a get5 issue on the game server. Please make sure all requirements are met for installing get5.

Q. What is this stupid support message?  
A. In order to get the message out about match management systems, a donation message is loaded each half. If you would like to disable it, simply put `get5_api_support_message 0` in your `live.cfg` :)

Q. Why are my demos not uploading?  
A. Make sure in your `warmup.cfg` and `live.cfg` have `get5_upload_demos 1` set. Or put it in your `server.cfg`.

Q. Why can't I use PNG files?  
A. In order to get these, you must set `get5_use_svg 0` in your `server.cfg` to make use of PNG formatted team logos.
